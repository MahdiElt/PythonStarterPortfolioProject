# PythonStarterPortfolioProject
Codeacademy's first portfolio project in the Data Science Path
Still trying to wrap my head around a lot of these concepts. I know there is a way to write most of the repetetive code into functions and 
make the code look a lot prettier. So far i have just been doing guided tutorials so ill have to spend some time looking through the python documentation
and playing with all the built in functions and libraries and what not. Once i learn more visualization tools ill have to add graphs and plot some lines of best fit 
for different variables. This project will actually be really nice to keep revisiting as i learn more about python and can act as a measure for my growth as well.
